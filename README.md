## WHAT'S THIS
This tool could use a traditional Chinese technique called "HongYiXuMing"(Extend someone's life by wearing a red T-Shirts), but the traditional way is too messy to do. So, I invented this is to extend life conveniently.This tool can be deployed on all smart machines.Whenever you use it, your life could be +1s for him and you can see a red word "+1s" floating above your head.   
FOR MORE? No comment!
